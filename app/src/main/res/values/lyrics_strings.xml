        (Verse 1)
        Every time you try to forget who I am
        I be right there to remind you again
        You know me (pow, pow, pow)
        You know me (pow, pow, pow)

        (Chorus)
        Said I am heartless
        And I am back to my ways because I am heartless
        All this money and this pain got me heartless
        Low life for life because I am heartless
        Said I am heartless
        Tryna be a better man but I am heartless
        Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
        Low life for life because I am heartless

        (Verse 2)
        Said I am heartless
        So much money on my mind, I be heartless
        Said I am heartless
        Said I am heartless
        (This is just a mock for the UI demo)
